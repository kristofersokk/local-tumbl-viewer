## Deployed

This project is deployed to [tumblviewer.app](https://tumblviewer.app/) with Vercel analytics. Because this has MIT license, if you want you can deploy it yourself on your own page. A small ask, leave the about page intact.

## Offline use

The app has the ability to load all necessary files and work offline. If there's an update, then the app lets you update the app.

The app supports installing as a standalone app. In desktop, install option is next to star in address bar. In android, either a install popup opens, or in menu choose "Add to Home screen".
